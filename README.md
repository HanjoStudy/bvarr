bvarr
=====

The package `bvarr` may be useful for estimating bayesian VAR models.
This is a translation to R of the matlab code by
[Gary Koops and Dimitris Korobilis](http://personal.strath.ac.uk/gary.koop/bayes_matlab_code_by_koop_and_korobilis.html)
with minor improvements.

You may install the package usinge the commands:
```R
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("bdemeshev/bvarr")
```

Very basic example of usage:
```R
library("bvarr")
data(Yraw)
model <- bvar(Yraw,prior = "independent")
bvar.imp.plot(model)
bvar.summary(model)
```

Todo:

1. Describe!!! Good documentation is a first need.

2. Check case with no constant!

3. Check case with exogeneous variables!

4. Check border case with M=1!

5. Move hyperparameters in the definition of the function in the
unified fashion. Something like: minnesota.hyper=c(...), ssvs.hyper=c(....), etc.

6. Make lovely function for prediction. Two types of prediction? 

7. Rewrite code using Rcpp.


You may also wish look at [BMR](http://bayes.squarespace.com/bmr/) and [MSBVAR](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MSBVAR/) packages. They seem to be more professional, but they do not contain something I wish for :) Maybe `bvarr` will be redesigned completely in late 2015.
